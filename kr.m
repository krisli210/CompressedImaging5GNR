%KR Khatri-Rao product.
%   kr(A,B) returns the Khatri-Rao product of two matrices A and B, of 
%   dimensions I-by-K and J-by-K respectively. The result is an I*J-by-K
%   matrix formed by the matching columnwise Kronecker products, i.e.
%   the k-th column of the Khatri-Rao product is defined as
%   kron(A(:,k),B(:,k)).
%
%   kr(A,B,C,...) and kr({A B C ...}) compute a string of Khatri-Rao 
%   products A o B o C o ..., where o denotes the Khatri-Rao product.
%
